This module outlines the practice of humanitarian engineering and sustainable development in least developed countries.

## Least Developed Countries

Recall SDG #1 is to end worldwide poverty. 

It is estimated that in 2018, 783 million people live under 1.90 USD a day. This is halved from 2000 which means that progress has been made.

**Least developed countries (LDC)** are 47 countries designated by UN where most of the poor people live. 

### LDC Criteria

The list of LDCs is reviewed every 3 years. There are three criteria:

1. Human assets
   - Secondary school enrollment (higher is better)
   - Under-nourishment (lower is better)
   - Maternal mortality (lower is better)
   - Adult literacy (higher is better)
   - Under five mortality (lower is better)
2. Economic vulnerability
   - Population (?)
   - Remoteness (lower is better)
   - Export concentration (higher is better)
   - Victims of natural disasters (lower is better)
   - Share of agriculture and fishing in GDP (?)
   - Share of population in costal zones (?)
   - Instability of exports (lower is better)
3. Income per capita
   - Income per capita graduation threshold: 1242 USD (2015)

If a country meets 2/3 of these three criterions for 2 reviews, or income per capita is that twice of the threshold for 2 reviews, they will graduate from the list.

### LDC Support

LDCs get exclusive access to support, such as:

- Duty-free access to EU market. 
- WTO grant different treatment to LDCs
- 0.15-0.2% of donor aids are given to LDCs
- Climate change financing

## Humanitarian Engineering

### Wicked Problems

Sustainability/humanitarian problems are often unique, a symptom of another problem, and never-ending. These can be called "wicked" problems. To deal with this, try:

- Interdisciplinary cooperation
- System thinking
- Iterative thinking

### Ethical Frameworks

### Failure
