## Drivers

Sustainability as an idea has existed for a long time, but there is a growing focus on **sustainable development** since the 1950s due to rapid increase of population, wealth, and health for all countries.

### Increasing Population

Because of better health, there exists a world population growth. It is estimated that the world population will reach 10 billion by the year 2055.

### Increasing Per Capita Consumption

Because of better wealth, people are consuming more resources. Canadians have one of the highest per-capita consumption rates. The **per capita material footprint** is the the sum of extracted material (typically non renewable) required for each person.

### Impact

The increase of both population and consumption per capita will lead to economic and ecological impacts. These impact could be positive (good) or negative (bad). The social or environmental impact can be roughly described by:

$$
\text{Impact}=\text{Population}\times\text{Affluence}\times\text{Technlogy}
$$

Some of the impacts we observe today are:

- Decrease in infant mortality.
- Drastic increase in green house gas emissions.
- Severe decrease in biodiversity due to climate change.
- Decrease in air and water quality.
- Increase in education.

## Definitions

The definition of **sustainable development**, according to United Nations[^1] is:

> *Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations to meet their own needs.*

The UN created 17 **sustainable development goals (SDGs)** where each goal has well defined *targets* and *indicators*. They can be found on [UN sustainable development website](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/)[^2].

**Carrying capacity** is the number of people who can be supported over a long period of time. Living within the carrying capacity depends on:

- the amount of resources available in the ecosystem
- the amount of resources consumed by each individual within the population

**Biocapacity** is the productivity of land areas such as forests, croplands, fisheries, and land for absorbing human waste.

**Ecological footprint (EF)** measures the current human demand on earth's ecosystems and natural resources. EF provides an estimate of the area of biologically productive land and sea to *sustainably* support human activities. The unit is [*area/year*]. The method of calculating EF is outlined [here](https://www.footprintnetwork.org/resources/data/)[^ef-method].

**Ecological deficit** is when the total ecological footprint is greater than the total biocapacity of the area available to that population.

**Natural capital** is the natural resources on Earth's biosphere that provide ecosystem goods and services imperative for survival and well-being[^nc]. Like financial capital, the idea is that we use the what we have in a way to ensure abundance of capital is maintained or increased over time.
