## Sustainable Issue(s) Relevant to the Spotlight SDGs

<!--Provide a concise statement describing the 2 SDGs addressed in the BN, and your rationale for focusing on these SDGs.--> 

The sustainability development goals (SDGs) are a set of objectives to pursuit a sustainable world. I will address SDG #4 and SDG #11, quality education and actions to climate change respectively.

### SDG #4: Quality Education

#### What is it?

SDG #4 involves providing quality and engaging education to everyone, including women and minorities. 

The quality education goal also seek to increase accessibility which means growth in supply of teachers and school staff. Quality education increases inclusion in schools. Quality also implies effectiveness of education, and the outcome is that people who are educated are more knowledgeable.

#### Targets

Targets for SDG #4 include: 

- ensure all girls and boys have access to free, equitable, and quality education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes. 
- ensure quality early childhood development for preparation for primary education
- ensure quality access for men and women to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, i.e. education (*later mention rise of online courses and how VR can make it more engaging, and there can be remote AR classrooms -- microsoft vision 2019*)
- Increase number of people who have relevant skills for employment and entrepreneurship
- eliminate gender disparities in education, include persons with disabilities and other vulnerabilities
- all achieve literacy and numeracy
- all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development
- increase supply of qualified teachers

#### Rationale

It is important that we focus on SDG #4 because it lays the foundation to help solve our sustainable problems by equipping the future generation with the skills and mindset they need. Focusing on education will also yield higher productivity and more educated and skilled employees in the long-term future.

### SDG #13: Climate Action

#### What is it?

For SDG #13, the goal is to take urgent actions against climate change, to mitigate climate-related hazards, and minimize further damage to the planet as well as the potential damages to what's already done. Actions also include increasing the resilience and adaptive capacity, implementing regulations, and improve education, and direct actions to reduce emissions.

#### Targets

The relevant targets consist of:

- Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and natural disasters in all countries
- Integrate climate change measures into national policies
- Improve education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change on mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning (relevant)

#### Rationale

One of the target for climate action goes hand-in-hand with improving education and awareness of human impacts on the planet capacity. It is important to consider the policies and strategies that government can put into place to integrate climate change measures, and it could affect businesses greatly. Development of more efficient processes in businesses and industries could cut down costs and reduce emission, ultimately a direct action to combat climate change.

<!--Clear understanding of sustainability is evident (see Module 1 for definitions and background information), Global and Canadian SDG targets and current achievement levels of SDG indicators are presented.-->

## Background on Spotlight SDGs

<!--
Present details of your above rationale. 
What do your firm’s leadership team need in order to understand the relevance of the spotlight SDGs to the firm? 
For example, your firm’s clients are typically Canadian municipalities, provincial governments or sometimes the federal government. 
The firm also has clients from industry (e.g. the forest products sector, and hi-tech sector) and agricultural sector. 
So why are the spotlight SDGs relevant to potential clients? 
Is the Canadian context important?  Is engineering particularly critical to your spotlight SDGs? 
What other information will help the leadership team understand your recommendation and help them make the best decision?
-->

### Rationale Details

#### Regarding SDG #4

The focus on quality education is important because it is applicable to everyone in wide ranges of geography, age, race, and skill-level. Our clients which consist of many Canadian municipal and provincial governments are highly relevant to SDG #4 as many education institutions are public. This also means increased chances of government funding or subsidiaries for investing effort in this goal.

By increasing the education levels in the population, we also increase the number of jobs as well as pool of skilled and knowledgeable workers to contribute to sustainability. 

#### Regarding SDG #13

The focus on climate actions is also important as it affects businesses, industries, and governments, all of which are our clients. 

While it is essential that we reduce our emissions and pollutions, and overall effects on the planet, government intervention is inevitable and will impact industries. 

As already demonstrated in Canada with the implementation of federal-level carbon tax, many industries such as agriculture are taking a hit [CITATION]. 

The economy can be buffered if they have more efficient processes and better training to better circumvent the problems. 

It is extremely relevant to our clients because we should contribute to SDG #13 by providing technology that better transitions the population and businesses to contribute SDG 13.

**Old text:**

> We chose quality education because education is relevant towards everyone at a wide range of ages. Since in Canada education is mostly public, and since our clients consist of Canadian municipalities, provincial governments, and sometimes the federal government. It would be a good idea to get funding while improving the goals in SDG #4 throughout the nation and ultimately around the world.
>
> In the long term, a better access to quality education will produce top talents and people with a lot of skills that can work in engineering, furthering the pursuit of sustainability. Which means money for us.
>
> We have clients in the industry that could use better efficiencies to combat climate change. It will help in addition to potential government policies that limit emissions (for example). Since Canada has just introduced carbon emissions, working towards SDG #13 is crucial to our clients since process efficiency is key.

## Current Global and National Status of Spotlight SDGs

<!--Describe the current levels of SDG achievement at the global and national levels, including the current achieved level of global and Canadian indicators.--> 

### Progress SDG #4

The targets for quality education mainly consists of: accessibility and participation, gender equality, and effectiveness in primary, secondary, and post-secondary educations. Also part of the targets are all learners have adequate skills for employment, entrepreneurship, as well as to promote sustainable development.

In least developed countries, problems regarding education are resolved slowly. In the 2016 report, the majority of problems arise from no access to education due to disparities such as being female or poor. The completion rates for primary and secondary education increased steadily since 2000 in developing and developed regions: 72% and 91% respectively in 2013. The total financial assistance amounts to \$1.2B[^prog4_2016].

In the 2017 report, the admission rate for primary and secondary schools gained significantly. However equity was still an issue as poor families could not afford to go to school. It is also reported that there are a shortage of trained teachers that hinders quality education. Only about 44%, 74% and 55% of the teachers are trained in pre-primary, primary, and secondary schools respectively. The total financial assistance decreased to \$1.0B[^prog4_2017].

In the 2018 report, early childhood participation was reported to increase by 7% from 63% between 2010 and 2016. The percentage of trained teachers increased to 85% globally[^prog4_2018]. 

In Canada, the education of the population has generally increased. In 2016, 54% of Canadians have post-secondary education, a rise of 6% since 2006, this makes Canada highest proportion of graduates among OECD countries[^prog4_a]. Similarly, participation of women in post-secondary education also increased from 32% to 41%.

Overall, the progression to the SDG #4 globally is very slow. The main problem are mostly lack of proper training and incentive for children to attend school. Due to poor engagement, participation, and lack of funding. However, Canada is leading by being one of the most educated countries, achieving most indicators specified by SDG #4.

### Progress SDG #13





## Key Considerations

<!--Here, you should provide a summary of important considerations that lay the foundation for your recommended “engineered option” aimed at achieving the Spotlight SDGs. Remember, your aim is to present ideas and concepts that will help the firm’s leader make an informed decision on where the firm should develop their engineering expertise in order to support the SDGs. Keep these needs uppermost in your mind when selecting and presenting relevant information. Even if they don’t go for your recommended option below, your explanation here may spark ideas of their own leading to even better options than the one you are recommending.-->

<!--Remember to substantiate any statements with evidence and to double check your facts. Additional details may be attached as appendices.-->

Consider that government is looking for alternative methods to improve our education rates. increase engagement means that more people are taking in the knowledge. We need to increase inclusion and the number of minorities that attend secondary and post-secondary education. So that we can have more skilled population, and overall increased productivity to work towards sustainability.

Having a more diverse pool of idea-makers will generally result in the best solution.

In industries, efficiency is key. Increasing training effectiveness and reduce hours wasted and provide increased productivity. Also maintenance and repair is often expensive and not very efficient, so it would be nice to improve in that respect. 

Government policies will be dropping in the next few years to pursue goal #13. Companies, especially entrepreneurs and smaller businesses need consulting in efficient processes.

Actions on being resilient in hazardous weather or climates is also important, and education on this is important too.

Urban design and other collaboration towards sustainability could be improved with AR/VR.

<!--Sustainability context for the engineered option is presented. For example, here are some questions that may (or may not) be key considerations. -What are other engineering firms doing in this area? -What is the client understanding of, and/or demand for, the engineered option? -What are possible problems? What are possible unintended consequences? -What are possible Long-term and/or Indirect implications? This is where you demonstrate systems thinking!-->

## Engineered Option

<!--Summarize one possible engineering option (e.g. green roof technology, solar towers, CO2 capture and sequestration technology, etc.) that will contribute to the achievement of the spotlighted SDGs. You are welcome to use one image (referenced) as you see fit (use you best judgement in making the trade-off between losing space for writing, and gaining the image).-->

<!--Make sure to provide the justification for this recommendation and, where appropriate, make reference to the considerations you mention above.-->

VR and AR technology is the engineered option to pursue SDG goals #4 and #13. VR and AR technology are similar in that VR is entirely virtual, while AR integrates the tracking and visualization of VR on top of the real optics.

VR and AR can drastically improve education engagement, and lead to better education output. People that go through the education system will be more knowledgeable and possess the skill to combat climate change, and other engineering problems. It can also provide a realistic and bigger picture of the problems that we are attacking such as climate change.

VR and AR is also accessible. In recent development by Google and Apple, and other internet companies. AR and VR can run on smartphones natively. The smartphone is single handedly the most accessible device on the planet, even more than toilets. Using smartphones, more people can have access to quality education content than ever. It progresses in goals for quality education such as increasing inclusion by providing education to women and those who are vulnerable for free via the internet. 

Governments can invest in our technology to use in education.

(mention process efficiency, training and cost saving)

<!--Concise description of option you are recommending, and justification for your recommendation that relates the option to the interests of the engineering firm, and also who the engineered option relates to sustainability.-->

## A Systems View

<!--Using either a concept map OR a causal loop diagram, graphically present the connections between, and implications of, your recommended engineered option about which the firm may want to develop expertise, and the spotlighted SDGs. This will graphically reinforce the value of your recommendation. Use your best judgement in terms of the size of the graphic image you wish to present. You are welcome to draw your map or CLD but you need to make sure that it is legible and professionally presented.-->

![Concept map](assets/asn4_concept_map.png)

<!--The Cmap or CLD is a graphic representation of your systems thinking. Be sure to present an improved version of your your SRL 3.-->

## Recommendation and Conclusion

<!--Summarize what you want your firm’s leadership team to infer from this BN. Be sure this section concisely covers the points you most want the team to be clear about. Do not introduce anything new in this section. Make sure the recommendation is clear, direct and substantiated by the facts you have put forward. You are gracefully summing up everything you have previously mentioned.-->

I recommend investing and developing in the area of AR/VR technology as it will significantly improve quality of education, local, and abroard because of its accessbility, effectiveness, and affordability.

<!--Summarize your BN and concisely state your recommendation to your engineering firm.-->
