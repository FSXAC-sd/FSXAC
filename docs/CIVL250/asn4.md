<!--Briefing Note Template-->

<!--This briefing note should be no more than 5 pages in length. Your submission should have the same font, spacing, and margins as this document -- i.e. to create your BN, fill in this document, without modifying the font, spacing, and margins.--> 

<!--Your submission should NOT include the template material presented in red font (e.g. do not include this paragraph in your Assignment 4 submission)-->

<!--Remember you are “selling” your recommendation to the firm leadership, so use an appropriate writing style as you see fit.-->

<!--Remember to submit your BN as a pdf.-->

To be removed: reference placeholders[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6]

## Sustainable Issue(s) Relevant to the Spotlight SDGs

<!--Provide a concise statement describing the 2 SDGs addressed in the BN, and your rationale for focusing on these SDGs.--> 

## Background on Spotlight SDGs

<!--Present details of your above rationale. What do your firm’s leadership team need in order to understand the relevance of the spotlight SDGs to the firm? For example, your firm’s clients are typically Canadian municipalities, provincial governments or sometimes the federal government. The firm also has clients from industry (e.g. the forest products sector, and hi-tech sector) and agricultural sector. So why are the spotlight SDGs relevant to potential clients? Is the Canadian context important?  Is engineering particularly critical to your spotlight SDGs? What other information will help the leadership team understand your recommendation and help them make the best decision?--> 

## Current Global and National Status of Spotlight SDGs

<!--Describe the current levels of SDG achievement at the global and national levels, including the current achieved level of global and Canadian indicators.--> 

## Key Considerations

<!--Here, you should provide a summary of important considerations that lay the foundation for your recommended “engineered option” aimed at achieving the Spotlight SDGs. Remember, your aim is to present ideas and concepts that will help the firm’s leader make an informed decision on where the firm should develop their engineering expertise in order to support the SDGs. Keep these needs uppermost in your mind when selecting and presenting relevant information. Even if they don’t go for your recommended option below, your explanation here may spark ideas of their own leading to even better options than the one you are recommending.-->

<!--Remember to substantiate any statements with evidence and to double check your facts. Additional details may be attached as appendices.-->

## Engineered Option

<!--Summarize one possible engineering option (e.g. green roof technology, solar towers, CO2 capture and sequestration technology, etc.) that will contribute to the achievement of the spotlighted SDGs. You are welcome to use one image (referenced) as you see fit (use you best judgement in making the trade-off between losing space for writing, and gaining the image).-->

<!--Make sure to provide the justification for this recommendation and, where appropriate, make reference to the considerations you mention above.-->

## A Systems View

<!--Using either a concept map OR a causal loop diagram, graphically present the connections between, and implications of, your recommended engineered option about which the firm may want to develop expertise, and the spotlighted SDGs. This will graphically reinforce the value of your recommendation. Use your best judgement in terms of the size of the graphic image you wish to present. You are welcome to draw your map or CLD but you need to make sure that it is legible and professionally presented.-->

## Recommendation and Conclusion

<!--Summarize what you want your firm’s leadership team to infer from this BN. Be sure this section concisely covers the points you most want the team to be clear about. Do not introduce anything new in this section. Make sure the recommendation is clear, direct and substantiated by the facts you have put forward. You are gracefully summing up everything you have previously mentioned.-->
