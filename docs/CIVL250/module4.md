## Components of the Urban Ecology

## Urban Intrustructure

Urban development is challenging because population density is high. Which makes cities vulnerable to:

- Disease epidemics
- Criminal activities
- Loss of affordable housing
- Social dysfunction

And also

- Natural disasters such as Earth quakes
- Increased airborne particulates from wild fires
- Flooding and drought
- Intense storms
- Higher sea level
  - Loss of underground infrastructure
  - Salinization of soil and aquifiers
- Decrease in agriculture producitivity 

### Resiliency in Cities

**Resiliency** is the means to adapt and be flexible to change.

Increasing resiliency of cities and systems such as infrastructure systems is an effective strategy to reduce citie's vulnerabilities.

These are the four main dimensions to a resilient city:

1. Health & Well Being
2. Economy & Society
3. Leadership & Strategy
4. Infrastructure & Environment

### Planet Scale Resiliency

On the planetary scale, we have many boundaries set for variables that may change our planet in a significant way. Going beyond these boundaries is dangerous.

The boundaries are:
- Ozone depletion
- Atmospheric aerosol load
- Ocean acidity
- Freshwater consumption
- Chemical pollution
- Agriculture land use
- Biodiversity loss
- Nitrogen flow
- Phosphorus flow
- Climate change

## Resiliency in Urban System Design

Ecosystem approach considers both direct and indirect effects.

> Ecosystem approach:
> - is a new perspective that challenges linear way of thinking.
> - helps us makes sense of the multitude of interactions that exist within a city.
> - helps us support through engineering design, the successful management of the individual elements of the larger city so as to benefits the elements as well as the city as a whole.
> - calls on us to develop awareness to both direct and indirect relationships and interactions that can exist between different elements in a city.
> - calls to understand that elements exist at different physical scales.
> - compells us to constantly be aware of interactions between subsystems within larger systems.
> - leads to analysis of infrastructure elements within its broader context
>   - flow of material, energy, and information in built & natural systems
>   - influence at different scales
>   - life-cycle of infrastructure (elements)
