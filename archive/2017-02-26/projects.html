                                                <strong>Objective:</strong>
                                                Using provided materials (aluminium, rubber bands, Arduino) to build an
                                                automatically triggering claw that can pick up various objects from cloth to soup
                                                cans.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Process:</strong>
                                                We ultilized "Collaborative Sketching" to generate 6 different ideas, two of
                                                which was decided to be promising for us. Further developments was done on CAD
                                                software Autodesk Inventor and drawings were produced.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                We used aluminium sheets and hand tools to manufacture claw parts using flat
                                                patterns from the CAD drawings. Experiments and risk analysis were made to make
                                                sure the claw performs to expectations.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The first iteration prototype was built directly from handtools, it was crude and
                                                controlled manually by hand and strings. Though rough and non-functioning,
                                                it gave us an idea of how the claw should work, and what we need to work on
                                                next.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Two more prototype made from cardboard were produced. They were used to experiment
                                                with picking up objects. The performance was scored based on if it was able to
                                                pick up certain objects, how well it picked them up, and the risk involved.
                                                We noticed one of our design is particularly good with picking up small
                                                objects such as dice and small rocks. But it lacks performance picking up
                                                large volume objects as the claw had trouble opening wide enough.

                        <p>
                            This APSC project involves technical skills such as CAD modelling and apply it to
                            develop a device for a disabled individual.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The designs and models are done individually, the technical report, elevator pitches,
                            and presentation are collaborated in the APSC group. Contributors:

                                        Throughout this project, we learned how to reduce risk and cost during the design
                                        process by building physical prototypes and mock-ups. This is because the project
                                        is physically oriented, where the target user's comfort and convenience is our
                                        top priority.

                                        Virtual models were then made on Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks and a technical
