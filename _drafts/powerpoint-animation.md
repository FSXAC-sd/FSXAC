- on newer powerpoint versions, make use of the “morph” transition
- add animation to bullet points because a sudden giant wall of text is not pleasant, using animation can build up entrance and anticipation
- do not use animation per letter or word unless it’s specifically for stylistic of emphasis purposes
- All animations should ideally stay under 0.5s, for animations that deals with text, keep it within 0.2 to 0.3s
- Add easing in animations
- Blinking animations for a “tech” feel
- Use exit animations to emphasize part of the screen.
