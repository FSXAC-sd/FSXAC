Welcome to my corner on the internet; here you will find my blogs, course notes, and projects.

**About Myself**

I'm a graduate student pursuing a Masters in Applied Science (M.A.Sc.) at the University of British Columbia, advised by [Prof. Mieszko Lis](http://mieszko.ece.ubc.ca/).
My current work involves computer architecture security ([Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability))) and performance simulation using the [gem5](https://www.gem5.org) simulator.

Along with years of teaching assistantship experience at UBC since 2017, my work experiences include: UI/UX programming with Frostbite engine and C++ at *[EA - BioWare](https://www.bioware.com)*, FPGA tools development at *[Intel - NSG](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/homepage.html)*, and application development at *[Vital Mechanics](https://www.vitalmechanics.com)*.
