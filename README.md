## About This Website

- Started in 2015-2016 more or less as a place to write my journal/log of learning programming
- Originally, I wrote all the HTML manually, later used Google App Engine, Amazon EC2, and finally Jekyll -- because it's just simpler and easier
- Started posting all my notes on my website in 2017 after getting note-taking jobs for UBC Access and Diversity; most notes are either handwritten with a tablet, or typed in Markdown (and rendered via Jekyll-Kramdown markdown renderer)

## Who is This For?

- For whoever interested in my "personal brand", for what is presented on the website is merely a fraction of who I am
- For people (recruiters etc) who looked me up
- For whoever might benefit from the notes for courses I've taken
- For myself

## Why Do I Put in So Much Work?

- This might as well as be my study-room on the web; Just like a real physical room, it needs cleaning and attention. Time and effort is put into organizing and decorting it is mostly for my own satisfaction -- a hobby.
