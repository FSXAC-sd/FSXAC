Over the last few weeks I've been trying to build the Macleod Building in survival Minecraft. After I heard the rumors about the demolishing of the Macleod building in the future, I thought it would be nice to keep a personal copy of it in my Minecraft world. To prolong the longevity of the build, I've limited myself to having no third-party mods except for server-side plugins, vanilla Minecraft data-packs, or client-only mods such as shader mods.

This is my first time trying to build something real 1:1 in Minecraft. Constraints include: limited block types in survival mode and every block is 1x1x1 in meters. This creates problems because I would need to round real life measurements into nearest meter; e.g. A hallway that is 1.3 meters wide would be too narrow if it was 1 block wide in Minecraft, but too wide if it's two blocks wide. For ceiling heights and wall thicknesses, I followed xRILLIANx's *Minecraft Architectural Standards* [^mas].

## Planning and Surveying

Starting a large project is hard but luckily the ECE website generously provided the floorplan for each floor [^floorplan].

Notice that there is a column that separated each set of window panes. The distance between the columns are consistent and thus became the reference point / grid system for the rest of the build. All the measurements are verified relatively to this distance. One big problem is that none of the floor plans provided from the website included a scale, so I went to Macleod building in real life and took a few measurements. I used built-in AR *Measure* app and it works pretty well.

Furthermore, for landscaping features, I used my camera to make visual references relative to the "window columns/pillars grid system". Lastly, I took a couple hundred more photos all around and inside the building for visual reference, so that I can use the right material in Minecraft to make it looking as close to the real thing as possible.

## Building

I started by experimenting with different materials for the walls, as that is what we see 90% of the time. The Macleod exterior is a mix of glass, white bricks, and concrete. In Minecraft, I substituted concrete with stone, white bricks with polished diorite. Unfortunately, there isn't any white bricks material (Mojang, please fix). I chose white concrete for the interior walls for the clean look.

For the floors and stairs, I chose stone and sandstone so that it matches the real colors better. In the real Macleod, the ceiling is made of tiles, so I chose smooth stone slabs.

Due to the limited build resolution in Minecraft, a lot of places feels cramped and small. It's difficult to feel the scale of things. As mentioned before, some compromises had to be made and certain details cannot be reproduced without scaling up the build. For example, the study rooms on third and forth floors are usually 3 meters wide, but because we cannot place half block vertically or have any wall thickness less than 1 block in Minecraft. The result is that study rooms are 1 block or 2 blocks wide.
