Here are some of the statistics I’ve collected for the APSC 160 labs. Because I only run the lab sections L1T, L1K, L1O, and L1D (for the first term). I only have the statistics for these sections.

This page will be updated for each labs.



## Results

**Lab 1**: by this point, I was only in section L1T (Thursday 12:00-14:00) and L1D (Friday 16:00-18:00).

**Lab 2**: Lab 2 features if/else branching. The lab section L1K showed that their version is the easiest.

**Lab 3**: Lab 3 is a bit harder, it consists of drawing grid of numbers using nested *while* loops.

**Lab 4**:

TBD



## Methods

Since lab 2, I’ve developed a custom program in Python that runs on my phone using *Pythonista* to perform the counting and logging for when a student submits their lab. The app automatically appends log entry to a *.txt* file.
