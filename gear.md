## Laptop

I use a MacBook Pro 13 inch M1 2020 nearly all of the time to get my work done. Apps/software I use:

- *iTerm 2* for many programming related tasks, I use *zsh* with *Oh-My-Zsh* plugin.
- *Visual Studio Code* for writing code and LaTeX.
- *Typora* for <dfn definition="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</dfn> Markdown editing. This is the app I use for most of my school notes as one can write their own CSS to customize Markdown and UI styles however they like.
- *Adobe Lightroom Classic CC* for photo editing and RAW processing.
- *Adobe Photoshop CC* for photo manipulation and graphic design.
- *Microsoft PowerPoint* for presentation, animation, and graphic design.
- *Final Cut Pro* for video editing.
- *Apple Motion 5* for 3D title graphics and motion graphics.

## Desktop

For more powerful tasks (which is not that common) such as gaming, rendering, and more demanding video editing, I use my Windows PC. Here are the specs:

- Intel Core i9 9900K 3.6 GHz 8-core processor (Overclocked to 4.2 GHz)
- Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB 3000 MHz DDR4 memory 
- Gigabyte Z390 AORUS Elite gaming motherboard
- Gigabyte Nvidia GTX 1060 Mini 6 GB graphics card.

## Peripherals

- *Keychron K6* Gateron Brown 65% mechanical keyboard.
- *HTC Vive* VR headset.
- *Dell S2716DG* 144 Hz WQHD monitor.
- *Sony WH-1000 MX3* noise cancelling headphones.
- *Apple Magic Trackpad*
- *Logitech MX Anywhere 2S* bluetooth mouse.

## Tablet

I use an iPad Mini (5th generation) along with Apple Pencil (1st generation) to take notes. The app I use to take notes is *Goodnotes 5* as it has excellent feel, tracking, document organization, and document export -- something OneNote has been lacking. I also use *Garageband* app to make "original" music for some of my projects (such as my Capstone project).
