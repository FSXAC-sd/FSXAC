1. Spelling mistake in apache config file (CGT instead of CGI) 

2. Had to start the cgi server using sudo a2enmod cgi and then restart apache using sudo service apache2 restart

3. Now gave forbidden error instead of file not found

4. In the conf-enabled and conf-available folders .. it was still showing /usr/lib/cgi-bin instead of /var/www/cgi-bin

5. Still have the error

6. Restarted the server

7. Now shows internal server error

8. Fixed the header in the python files so that they work for 2.7
