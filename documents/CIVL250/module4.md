## Components of the Urban Ecology

Within an urban ecology there are three primary subsystems:

1. The built environment.
2. Urban social systems.
3. The bio-physical environment.

Built environment could be infrastructure systems. The streets are at the lowest level of systems nested in larger urban systems:

The urban social systems are made of urban societies brought together by a variety of different socio-economic, national, and professional cultures. Communities such as neighborhoods, organizations, clubs, businesses are social systems that influence peoples’ behaviors.

Peoples’ behaviors also impact built systems and bio-physical systems within the urban ecology. E.g. a large demand for electric cars in the neighborhood prompts the city to install electric chargers (built structure) and reduces gas-car emissions and noise (bio-physical).

### Livability

**Livability** is the quality of interactions between people and the urban environment.

Indicators of livability:

- Air quality
- Walkability
- Working conditions
- Cultural activities
- Sports activities
- Volunteerism in communities
- Housing affordability

Vancouver, BC has been recognized as one of the most livable cities in the world.

### Ecosystem Services in Cities

Recall [module 1](/documents/CIVL250/module1), ecosystem services are benefits healthy ecosystems provide in an urban environment. 

**Bats in Bristol**: Bats provide benefits such as reducing the mosquito population in urban areas. Brightly lit areas create a barrier which makes bats less likely to move from tree to tree; thus impacting the health of the bat population and hindering the benefits from bats.

**Birds in Vancouver**: Birds are important to eliminate insects and urban pests such as rats. Vancouver created [Bird Strategy](https://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/vancouver-bird-strategy.aspx) aiming to create an attractive and supportive urban environment to native birds.

## Urban Infrastructure

**Megacities** are very large cities with population &gt; 10 million people. Due to urbanization, there increasing number of megacities.  

Urban development is challenging due to dense population which makes (mega)cities vulnerable to these concerns associated with climate change and biodiversity loss:

- Disease epidemics
- Criminal activities
- Loss of affordable housing
- Social dysfunction/riots
- Natural disasters such as earthquakes
- Increased airborne particulates from wildfires
- Flooding and drought
- Intense storms
- Rise in sea level
- Loss of underground infrastructure
- Salinization of soil and aquifers
- Decrease in agriculture productivity

### Resiliency in Cities

**Resiliency** is the means for the society in an urban environment to survive, adapt, and grow under chronic or acute stress. Increasing resiliency of cities and systems such as infrastructure systems is an effective strategy to reduce cities' vulnerabilities.

**Integrated plans** address and responds to the challenges effectively.

There are seven qualities of resilient frameworks for systems to “withstand, respond to, and adapt more readily to shocks and stresses after tough times, and live better in good times”. They are:

1. Reflective (i.e. learning from past experience)
2. Robust
3. Flexible
4. Integrated (i.e. systems are working and communicating in effectively)
5. Resourceful
6. Redundant
7. Inclusive

### City Resilience Framework

The CRF aims to understand the complexity of cities and the drivers that contribute to resiliency. There are four main dimensions to a resilient city, each with three drivers.

#### Dimension 1: Health & Well Being

1. **Basic needs satisfied**: all have access to basic resource needed to survive (food, water, sanitation, energy, and shelter).
2. **Support livelihood and employment**: have diverse career, investment, and social welfare opportunities; adequate skills, training, and labor policies.
3. **Public health**: effective public healthcare.

#### Dimension 2: Economy & Society

1. **Promote cohesive and engaged communities**: collective identity and mutual support; encouraging diversity, tolerance/inclusion for other cultures.
2. **Social stability, security, and justice**: comprehensive law enforcement to ensure safety and justice.
3. **Foster economic prosperity**: availability of funding; diverse economy; attract business investments.

#### Dimension 3: Leadership & Strategy

1. **Encourage leadership and effective management**: strong leadership, cross-sector communication, and evidence-based decision-making.
2. **Broad range of stakeholders**: everyone is informed and involved in the city; communication between the government and public is timely.
3. **Foster long-term and integrated planning**: align sectoral plans and projects to city’s vision and appropriately address city’s needs.

#### Dimension 4: Infrastructure & Environment

1. **Provide or enhance protective assets**: provide or maintain protective assets, natural or built, such as sea walls or wetlands.
2. **Ensure critical services continuity**: actively manage and enhance natural and man-made resources.
3. **Reliable communication and mobility**: free flow of people, information, and goods.

### Rotterdam Case Study

Rotterdam is a city in Netherlands which aims to make its inhabitants fully resilient to climate change by 2025 with five primary themes in its strategy:

1. Flood management.
2. Accessibility for ships and passengers.
3. Adaptive buildings.
4. Urban water systems.
5. Quality of life within the city.

Rotterdam has build infrastructures based on consideration of the CRF dimensions and drivers.

#### Floating Pavilion

- Responds dynamically to climate change and sea level rise.

#### Benthemplein Water Square

- When the weather is dry, the square is a community plaza offering a place to socialize.
- During heavy rainfall, basins in the square and surrounding rooftops collects water.

#### Dakakkers Green Rooftops

- Urban agricultural rooftop on top of an old building.
- Supplies the city with vegetables and honey.
- Collection and retention of excess rain water.
- Reduces roof temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>.

#### Museum Park Garage

- Repurposed parking garage to hold 10 million L of water during excess downpour when sewer system is going to overflow.
- Rainwater is discharged after into the sewer.

#### Dakpark

- Roof park to offer green space for residents and businesses.
- Located on top of a mall/shopping center.
- Park provides community recreation such as yoga classes and workshops.

### Planet Scale Resiliency

On the planetary scale, we have many boundaries set for variables that may change our planet in a significant way. Going beyond these boundaries is dangerous.

Johan Rockstrom[^jr]  describes the nine planetary boundaries we need to live within to ensure sustainable development:
- Ozone depletion
- Atmospheric aerosol load
- Ocean acidity
- Freshwater consumption
- Chemical pollution
- Agriculture land use
- Biodiversity loss
- Nitrogen flow
- Phosphorus flow
- Climate change

To ensure we are within the boundary, we began retrofitting urban environments for sustainability. Examples such as the [Rotterdam case study](#Rotterdam-Case-Study), in Vancouver, and on UBC campus.

## Resiliency in Urban System Design

`todo`

Ecosystem approach considers both direct and indirect effects.

> Ecosystem approach:
> - is a new perspective that challenges linear way of thinking.
> - helps us makes sense of the multitude of interactions that exist within a city.
> - helps us support through engineering design, the successful management of the individual elements of the larger city so as to benefits the elements as well as the city as a whole.
> - calls on us to develop awareness to both direct and indirect relationships and interactions that can exist between different elements in a city.
> - calls to understand that elements exist at different physical scales.
> - compels us to constantly be aware of interactions between subsystems within larger systems.
> - leads to analysis of infrastructure elements within its broader context
>   - flow of material, energy, and information in built & natural systems
>   - influence at different scales
>   - life-cycle of infrastructure (elements)

`todo` (prof's response):

> Hi Muchen,
>
> Thanks for asking for more clarification. I'm sure many students are thinking the same thing. 
>
> So, this approach asks that we think of urban infrastructure through the lens of, or from the perspective of, complex systems theory.
>
> More specifically, when thinking about urban infrastructure and urban systems generally (i.e. when thinking about the urban ecology), be aware of:
>
> - the existence of systems
>
> - multiple scales (physical scales, time scales, organization scales, etc)
>
> - direct and indirect relationships (also called "interdependencies") between components within systems, and between sub-systems (e.g. health & transportation. another classic is water & energy) 
>
> - system boundaries
>
> - the flow of materials, energy, and information across system boundaries
>
> - system change and the role of life-cycles - i.e. complex systems are continually learningresiliency
>   A systems thinker observes the behaviour of systems and how the behaviour changes over time. S/he looks for "leverage points" in systems where interventions can be made that will likely result in the system moving to desirable behaviour. (Good parenting is often cited as an example of systems thinking!)

In essence, I see it as a management stance enabling at least the temporary achievement of specific goals related to environmental stewardship and sustainability.

> James Kay and others have shown us that the ecosystem approach to urban systems has a solid scientific foundation enabling us to bridge the gaps between the built environment, social systems, and the bio-physical world, so that we can effectively strive for sustainability. While examples of the ecosystem approach to urban systems exist, we are all still learning about the details of what this approach really means.
