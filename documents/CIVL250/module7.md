## Envisioning a Sustainable World

### Scenario Planning

> `todo`
>
> Scenario planning is a forecasting technique used by organizations to  prepare for the long term (i.e. 10 to 30 years). It involves preparing  multiple future scenarios all at once.  It asks the question: "what  should we do today in order to prepare for multiple futures?"
>
> Because it's impossible to explore the infinite number of possible  and plausible futures, it's important to choose a handful of future  scenarios that represent the diversity of all possible futures, that,  together, capture the relevant uncertainties and possible causes of  future events.
>
> In scenario planning, there is no need to predict specific events.  It's more important to identify the smaller number of possible effects  that these events can trigger. For example, for a company that sources  it's feedstock from a particular region of the world, any number of  events (earthquakes, flood, war, etc.) may reduce the feedstock flow for  the company. For the company, there is no need to predict specific  events. Instead, it's important that the company prepare for what to do  should their feedstock be reduced. 



Material consumption improve human well-being?

> `todo`
>
> Yes, but only to a threshold level of consumption (i.e. people need  to have food, shelter, transportation, and so on, in order to be  contented). Beyond this threshold level, other things contribute to  human happiness. For example, interactions with friends and family,  interactions with nature, that contribute to human well-being.
>
> Studies show that people who highly materialistic suffer from higher rates of mental and physical illness.

### Bhutan Case Study

Fundamentally, Bhutan strives to improve GNH rather than GDP. (i.e. the government invests in education, cultural celebrations, health care, and other public goods). The country is carbon neutral because it is able to offset it's GHG emissions via ecological capital that sequesters CO2 (e.g. it's forests).
