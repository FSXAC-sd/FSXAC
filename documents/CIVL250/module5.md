## Material Resources & Productivity

**Supply chain** is a sequence of activities to the delivery of a product or service to the *end user*. Supply chain consists of resource gathering, manufacturing, production, transportation, usage, and end of life.

**Cotton Clothing Supply Chain**:

1. Fiber production: uses land, water, and energy
2. Spinning, weaving, and dyeing: uses water and energy
3. Cutting, sewing, and finishing: uses water, poor human health and labor practices
4. Distribution: energy use, and produce packaging
5. Retail: energy use
6. Use: water and energy use
7. End of life: ecotoxity from landfill, which leads to poorer health

### Material Consumption

From [module 1](module1), we know that the consumption per individual is increasing.

The industrial products depends on natural resources. Natural resources are important source of income and jobs, provide ecosystem services, and necessary for human and economic development.

Amount of material extracted in 2010 is 72Gt, doubled since 1980. This is projected to 100Gt by 2030.

Material consumption is mostly construction materials (36%), fossil fuel (28%), and biomass for food and feed (20%).

### Decoupling Material Consumption

**Decoupling** of material resource means to increase GDP without increasing material consumption. The **dematerialization** requires:

1. Government level policies
   - Promoting life-cycle orientated approaches (Apple's LIAM)
   - Fees for use of resources (decrease incentive to over use)
   - Charges for environmental damage (decrease incentive to pollute)
   - Supporting longer product lifespans such as:
     - Increased legal minimum warranty periods
     - Right to repair
2. New business models based on process efficiencies (less material is more value).
3. Consumer awareness (buy less stuff, drive less, etc.).

## Biomimicry in Engineering Design

**Biomimicry** is innovation inspired by nature. Biologist are stakeholders of the design and we look at nature to see how they solve the problems we're trying to solve.

Biomimicry design process is similar to the engineering design process ([from APSC 100](/documents)).

![Module 5 Lesson 2-5](assets/Module 5 Lesson 2-5.png)

**Similarities**

- Both processes starts with studying the problem, defining the scope and context.
- Both has a brainstorming/idea generation phase.
- Both iterates (loops) to incrementally improve the design.
- Both has a testing phase (emulation step)

**Differences**

- An additional step for biomimicry design process (*discovery*) which involves studying the nature and abstracting its functions.
- There's a further evaluation phase for biomimicry design process.
- There seem to be lack of screening/selection (identify most promising solution) phase for biomimicry design process.

### Design Principles

Biologists postulates that life on earth follows 6 design principles:

1. **Evolve to survive**: continuously improving performance through generations by replicating strategies that work, learn from mistakes, and has random mutation.
2. **Adapting to change**: responds to dynamic contexts by incorporating diversity, self renewal (healing), resilience through variation, redundancy, and decentralization.
3. **Locally attuned and responsive**: fit in by take advantage of repeating events, use abundant resources, use information feedback, and co-operate in win-win situations.
4. **Integrate development with growth**: invest in strategies that promote long term development and growth.
5. **Resource efficient**: minimize energy use
6. **Life-friendly chemistry**

![Module 5 Lesson 2-6](assets/Module 5 Lesson 2-6(1).png)

The six principles are successful with Earth’s 4 operating conditions:

1. Sunlight, water, gravity
2. Dynamic non-equilibrium (weather, currents, etc.)
3. Limits and boundaries
4. Cyclic processes (seasons, etc.)

### Biomimicry in Consumer Products

Here are some of the consumer products that follow biomimicry: 

**Colored Fabric Without Dyes**: Chemical dyes require pigments from nature (natural resource usage), toxic, and require energy to process and apply. :face_with_head_bandage: Butterflies wings are to refract light that changes the wavelength of light, giving it colors.

**Mussel and Gecko Adhesion**: Glues lose their stickiness when wet. An adhesive can be made inspired from dry gecko feet and wet mussel adhesion. The end result works in both wet and dry conditions.

**Neural Network Machine Learning**: Machine learning that uses neural network to perform computer vision or detect faces is inspired by how neurons work in our brains. Axons in the neuron fire signals with simple rules, but with lots of neurons and nodes, we can train a network to be useful.

**Sonar**: Using ultrasonic waves to detect proximity is inspired by bats.

**Highspeed train**: Bullet train nose’s profile is inspired by highspeed birds. The aerodynamics observed in nature inspired the design of flat and sharp nose to reduce noise, stress, and structural damages.

### Biomimicry in Construction Products

Here are some of the construction products that follow biomimicry:

**Self-Healing Concrete**

Concrete is known to deteriorate over time. Self-healing concrete uses microfibers to fill in cracks. A chemical reaction occurs similar to ones found in seashells and renews the concreate strength.

## Industrial Ecology

### Kalundborg Symbiosis

Biggest companies in Kalundborg participate in the industrial ecology where the waste of one company becomes the material of another. The result is close to net-zero waste and increased economic growth.

> `todo` 
>
> *from quiz*
>
> Collaboration to utilize each other's waste products to form a closed system. The by product of one company is the material of another company (output becomes input).
>
> Environment as foundation, and increases economic prosperity because it's cheaper to re-use materials.

### Industrial Ecology in Cities

Idea of industrial ecology can be applied to cities to monitor energy and material flow in and out of the city.

## The Circular Economy

### Denmark Real Estate Case Study



Vancouver projects to become zero-waste city by <mark>2040</mark>. Currently, a website will educate where different kinds of waste should go so that materials are properly disposed and recycled. Vancouver rate has recycle rate of 94%; 6% loss are due to contamination.



## Construction Waste

![1565760865306](assets/module5/1565760865306.png)

The construction industry uses the most materials worldwide so we need to consider recycling and reusing construction waste to cut down material consumption and GHG emissions.

### Reusable and Recyclable Materials

**Recycled aggregates**: aggregates and debris from demolitions can be reused for building foundations, concrete, and asphalt; cutting down a project’s footprint.

**Asphalt rubber**

**Metals**

**Rebar**





## The Life-Cycle-Assessment Methodology

Formal LCA follows four steps:

1. Goal and scope (purpose, boundaries affected, and functional unit)
2. Definition inventory (inflows and outflows)
3. Impact assessment (classify eco-impacts)
4. Interpretation

**Review**

- 7 stages of cotton clothing supply chain:
  1. Fibre production
  2. Spinning, weaving, and dyeing
  3. Cutting, sewing, and finishing
  4. Distribution
  5. Retail
  6. Use
  7. End of life
- The annual amount of materials extracted worldwide (72Gt) has increased since 1980.
- **Dematerialization** is the *decoupling* of economic growth from natural resource consumption. Requirements:
  1. Government policies to support dematerialization.
  2. Business model includes improved efficiency or production.
  3. Greater consumer awareness and less materialism.
- For most developed countries, economic growth is decoupling from **per-capita consumption**, but total natural usage is increasing due to population growth.
- Six life’s design principles:
  1. Evolve to survive
  2. Adapt to changing conditions
  3. Locally attuned and responsive
  4. Integrate development with growth
  5. Resource efficient
  6. Use life-friendly chemistry
