*What is your desired career path post-graduation? Are there particular industries you are interested in or do you have a*
*specific type of role in mind? What about the size of company? Does it align with your core values? Does this career path align with where you want to be in your career in 5-10 years?*

> My desired career path still derives from engineering involving software and electronics nonetheless. A few co-op terms have given me an idea of industry I want to a part of. In particular the video game industry or some other generic tech company like Microsoft or Apple, with more focus on the boundary between hardware and software, rather than pure algorithmic software.
>
> The size of the company only matters when I consider potential benefits such as housing, food, health care, etc. as smaller startups do not often offer them. Otherwise, it is the size and dynamics of the *team* that really matters. I prefer a smaller team because it means the team is often more multi-disciplinary, more responsibility per individual, and more agile.
>
> My core values consist of several aspects: health, diversity & inclusivity in the workplace, and the idea that what I'm doing is serving people in a net positive way (moral compass). Generally, the tech sector industries align with these values with the exception of privacy. I believe that privacy, especially recently, should be the top most priority -- which is why I **do not** think Google, Facebook, and Amazon align with my core value. Further, I believe that the company should promote personal fitness, health, and mindfulness as it allows employees to be more productive. 

*Are you extroverted or introverted? How has this affected your work performance to date and how do you think this will*
*impact the type of job you will seek in the future?*

> I am introverted. It will not affect me at all on a professional level. In fact, being introverted means I'm usually more observant. I am not hindered during the interview process. Being introverted will not affect jobs that I currently have done, which are mostly desk-jobs. Being introverted allows me to be introspective, and self-reflect better.
>
> From work experience, I also perform well on oral presentations, meetings, and status reports. Therefore, I do not think being introverted will impact any of the jobs in the career I want to pursue.
>
> Being introverted will affect my ability to create and maintain meaningful long-term friendship and networks. Since social activities such as small-talks, lunch time, and other outside-of-work social activities are my weak points. 

*Does the career path you are currently interested in offer a lot of room for personal challenge and skill development, as*
*well as long-term career growth?*

> Yes, there's always rooms to grow since software and electronics technology is one of the most volatile area of the tech industry. 
>
> For software, it is possible that the paradigm and practices, and standards could change as fast as two to three years.

*What is the job security in this career or industry like for the next 5-10 years? Are there any major economic factors that*
*might adversely affect job prospects in this field?*

> 

*How relevant are you to your desired career path/industry at this time? Are your skills and experience in line with what the market is seeking, or is there additional training, self-directed learning, professional development opportunities you can seek out that would give you a competitive edge?*

> Yes

*What kind of autonomy and control do you want over your career and day-to-day work? Will this impact the type of*
*company you explore working for?*

> 

*Where are you willing to live? Think about the factors of an area that contribute to your personal long-term happiness such as access to outdoor areas, thriving nightlife, energetic culture, walkability or commute time, proximity to family, etc. Are the careers or industries you are interested in available in these type of areas?*

> 

*What aspects of a potential career will contribute to your long-term job satisfaction, or in other words, what would make you happy to go in to work every day?*
