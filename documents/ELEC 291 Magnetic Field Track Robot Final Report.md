### Objectives

The objective of this project is to design, build, program, and test an autonomous robot which is controlled using the magnetic field generated by a guide wire.

```

### Specifications

**Guideline wire frequency**: 16kHz

**Guideline wire communication baud-rate**: 15.625 (64.00ms per bit)

**Battery life**: ~20 minutes (drawing 500mA on a 9V alkaline battery)

#### Parts List

A detailed parts list is included in the appendix.

#### Software Features

##### Robot

- Reads commands sent through via the wire's magnetic field as binary (self made UART)
- Supports interpretation from binary up to 4 bits
- Supports the following commands (transmitted via binary as mentioned above):
  - Stop
  - Turn left at the next detected intersection
  - Turn right at the next detected intersection
  - Track forward
  - Track backward
  - U-turn (rotates 180 degrees)
- Proximity detection using sonar sensor
  - Stops the robot when objects directly in front of the robot is detected
- LED Matrix Visualizer that displays bitmapped pixel art that associates to the command
- Blinker LEDs to simulate turn signal

##### Guideline Controller

- Generates 16kHz square wave in the guideline wire for the robot to follow
- Sends commands to the robot using binary by switching the 16kHz signal on or off (self made UART)
- Sends the binary for the following commands:
  - Stop
  - Turn left at the next detected intersection
  - Turn right at the next detected intersection
  - Track forward
  - Track backward
  - U-turn (rotates 180 degrees)
