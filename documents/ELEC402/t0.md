## Computer Access

You can physically go to the computer lab (this is obviously not possible right now). Thus we have to remote-connect into the computers using SSH clients and remote desktop.

### VPN Access

In order to connect, you need to be on UBC myVPN. Instructions for Windows and Mac:

- Download Cisco Anyconnect
- Connect the thing (myvpn.ubc.ca) with CWL login

For Linux/Ubuntu, download OpenConnect: <https://it.ubc.ca/services/email-voice-internet/myvpn/myvpn-setup-gnulinux>

### Remote Desktop

Remote desktop client weâ€™re using is *X2go*; follow instructions on UBC ECE Wiki: <https://help.ece.ubc.ca/X2go>.
