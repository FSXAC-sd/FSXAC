## Comparative Planetology

This is the study of similarities and differences of “planets”, including moons, asteroids and comets.

## Basic Patterns

- All planets orbit the Sun in the same orientation (counter clockwise)
- All planets almost in the same plane.
- The sun contains 99.9% of the system’s mass.
- Inner planets are rocky, outer planets are icy or gas-rich.
- Crater production (e.g. impact basins) was larger in the past.

**Terrestrial planets**: inner planets that are small, rocky, solid surface, has few moons

**Jovian planets**: large size and mass, low desnity, now solid surfaec, farther from the sun, cooler, many moons or rings=[p]
